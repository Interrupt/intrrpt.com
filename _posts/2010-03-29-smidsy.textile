title: Breaking down the SMIDSY
layout: post
---

I ran across a pilot episode for an as of yet unproduced series of motorcycle crash safety videos called _Crash Course_. The idea itself is a great one, take a common type of accident and break it down showing what went wrong and how it could be avoided or prevented. I've only seen this kind of advice offered at MSF riding classes and in random posts in riding forums, it'd be nice for new riders if they had easier access to this information.

This first episode breaks down an accident common enough over the pond that it's known there as a SMIDSY, an acronym for "Sorry Mate, I Didn't See Ya", which describes the accident caused when someone pulls out in front of your vehicle. This is a common enough accident in the states that it's almost a shame the term hasn't been adopted here - my car was totalled after a SMIDSY incident last winter.
